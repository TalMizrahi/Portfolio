# About the project - please read

In this project, I analyzed a Government review of Insurance Call's waiting time in 2016.

**Important - This project isn't ended.** 

I need to visualize, present the conclusions and to upload a description with specific questions which led me to do the analysis. In the meantime, you can have a look at the SQL file.
