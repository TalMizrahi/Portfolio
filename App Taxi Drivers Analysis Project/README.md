# Details about the project - please read

In this project, I analyzed and presented data analysis of the Taxi Drivers activity in App.

**Important:** I couldn't attach the data itself for the reason of confidential.

However, I can attach the SQL query and the main parts of the presentation.

When a driver is on online mode, he's ready to take a trip and busy mode means he took a trip to another company.

The drivers should be online or busy for at least 30 hours a week to receive a weekly payment of $50 for a week.

Main goals of the analysis are:

Describe your conclusions derived from the data.

Are there any particular drivers that need special attention? why?

what are your recommendations based on the data?
